<center><big><b>Phase 1 &nbsp; <i>A Multitasking OS</i></b></big></center></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Our OS kernel can <i>multitask</i>, driven by a timer device which
interrupts the CPU to switch from the execution of a process code to
the kernel code. We have programmed a timer lab in previous 0. The
creation, scheduling, and running of small and simple processes will
be carried out in a simple fashion in this phase.
<li>
The pseudo code is given in the <i><b>pseudo-code</b></i> folder to
help you construct the OS of the 1st phase. How the timer is acknowleged
and serviced is crucial to construct this phase correctly. A process
<i>trapframe</i> is used to achieve the context switching between a
process and the kernel code, as well as the creation of a process.
<li>
To copy the given files, issue a shell command "<b><i>cp
~changw/html/159/1/pseudo-code/* .</i></b>" The "dot" signifies that
the current directory is the destination. (Avoid using <i>copy-paste</i>
from a web browser since this may incur unwanted Windows <i>ctrl-M</i>
characters which may cause compiler errors.)
</ol>
<p>

<h3>What's in "pseudo-code"</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In <b><i>pseudo-code</i></b> directory are actual and pseudo code.
During main() your OS bootstraps:
<ul>
<li>initialize the kernel data and control,
<li>create the first process <i>InitProc</i> (it will have PID 0),
<li>call process Scheduler to select a process to run,
<li>run the selected process.
</ul>
<p>
<li>
When <i>InitProc</i> runs it repeatedly flashes a dot symbol at
the upper-left corner on the display of the target PC, approximately
once a second. The timer device triggers a timer service routine (SR)
at a rate of 100 times a second.
<p>
<li>
The timer SR counts the runtime of the process that is current running.
If it reaches the OS time slice, the kernel would suspend it and choose
a different process to run (if any other available).
A pool of processes that are ready to run have their PID's queued into
a <i>ready queue</i> (<i>ready_q</i>) to be selected to run. Our kernel
switches processes by a <i>round-robin</i> fashion.
<p>
<li>
The kernel code also checks if the target PC keyboard is pressed. If yes,
it will be polled and served:
   <ul>
   <li><i><b>b</b></i>, call <i>breakpoint()</i> to go to the GDB
   prompt to debug the code or enter 'quit' to end the run.
   <li><i><b>n</b></i>, call SR <i>NewProcSR()</i> to create a new process.
   </ul>
<p>
<li>
The <i>TimerSR()</i> upcounts the <i>run_count</i> in the Process Control
Block (PCB) of the process currently running. When it counts upto
<i>TIME_SLICE</i>, the process is <i>suspended</i> with its PID appended
to the ready queue, and state changed. The TimerSR() also notify PIC that
the service is done.
<p>
<li>
When the running process is missing (NONE) or InitProc (PID 0), the
<i>Scheduler()</i> dequeues the 1st PID from the ready PID queue as
the newly selected running PID. In case the ready queue is empty,
InitProc (PID 0) will be selected.
<p>
<li>
All PID's are initially queued in the PID queue (<i>pid_q</i>). The
initial state is <i>UNUSED</i>. As a new process is created, a PID
from this queue is retrieved. A PID is used as an array index used
in the Process Control Block (<b>pcb</b>) and Process Stack
(<b>proc_stack</b>). To create a new process, the NewProcSR() code
initializes the PCB and creates a process trapframe in the process stack.
The PID is then queued to the <i>ready_q</i>. Its state is set to READY.
<p>
<li>
Each queue has a array of Q_SIZE numbers: <i>int q[Q_SIZE]</i> and a
<i>int tail</i> which indicates both the current size of the queue
and the location (array index) to add a new number. The <i><b>lib.c</i></b>
facilitates a set of queuing functions and <i>Bzero()</i> to clear all
bytes to 0 in a memory block.
<p>
<li>
Each <i>Process Control Block (PCB)</i> contains:
   <ul>
   <li><i>state_t</i> <b>state</b>, a process state: UNUSED, READY, or RUN;
   <li><i>int</i> <b>run_count</b>: a timer interrupt count, reset it when
   the process is selected;
   <li><i>int</i> <b>total_count</b>: accumulated timer counts since the
   creation of the process;
   <li><i>trapframe_t *</i><b>trapframe_p</b>: location of the CPU context
   in the process stack.
   </ul>
<p>
<li>
To create a process is to create a trapframe in the process runtime stack
by <i>NewProcSR()</i>. It is loaded as the CPU context to run.
The context of the CPU can also be saved to a trapframe in the process
runtime stack at an interrupt event. To resume a process the trapframe
is loaded back to the CPU. Given a trapframe address, the <i>Loader()</i>
can load it to run. A simple process trapframe can contain:
   <ul>
   <li><i>unsigned int</i> <b>reg[8]</b>, space for 8 CPU registers;
   <li><i>unsigned int</i> <b>eip</b>, where instruction is;
   <li><i>unsigned int</i> <b>cs</b>, where code segment is;
   <li><i>unsigned int</i> <b>efl</b>, CPU flags.
   </ul>
<p>
<li>
Process <i>InitProc</i> is created during the OS bootstrap in <i>main()</i>.
The instruction pointer of the CPU <i>eip</i> in the trapframe points
to <i>InitProc()</i>. For other processes created by pressing the
<i>'n'</i> key, their <i>eip</i> will point to <i>UserProc()</i> instead.
<p>
<li>
Part of the timer interrupt service is to notify the PIC device that the
timer service is done. Otherwise, the <i>PIC</i> will not give the CPU
the next timer interrupt (presuming the CPU is still busy.)
<p>
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
<li>
You should form a team of maximum 3 persons, and mail the instructor:
your OS team name and the member names. Similar to the convention of
naming a variable, a team name must not use spaces or special symbols,
and is case sensitive.
<li>
Submit all necessary source files only. Do not submit files generated
by the compiler or SPEDE. Source files have endings in <b><i>.c</i></b>,
<b><i>.h</b></i>, and <b><i>.S</b></i>.
<li>
Penalty will be applied if not following the instructions. This includes
accidental cloberring or incorrect file placement in the dropbox system.
Please do this correctly.
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
What is a process trapframe and how is it used?
<li>
Why <i>asm("sti");</i> is not seen in phase 1? (Used in the 'timer prep.')
<li>
How can the <i>round-robin</i> process scheduling be modified to carry
out other scheduling types such as the <i>shortest-job-first</i> policy?
</ol>

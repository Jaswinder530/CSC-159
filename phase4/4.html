<h3>Goal</h3>
<blockquote>
The goal of this phase is to learn the basics of device drivers,
in order to extend our OS services to peripheral devices such as
text terminals for tests.
</blockquote>

<h3>Device Driver Software</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Almost every peripheral device is coupled with a software to be
included as part of the OS services. This can be done by:
<ol type=a>
<li> busy-wait: use a delay in code including sleep,
<li> busy-poll: busy repeatedly reading the status of the device
until it is ready again, (can time it and issue a time-out),
<li> an interrupt-driven method via a feedback signal (so the CPU
can perform other tasks instead), or
<li> a hybrid from above.
</ol>
<p>
<li>
An I/O device is usually much slower than the CPU, a device driver,
after issuing work to an I/O device, would suspend itself for the OS
to run other processes. And when the I/O completes, the hardware will
issue an interrupt signal (similar to a timer device interrupt) and
the OS will then respond to it (to resume the device driver to continue).
<p>
<li>
Instead of using argument <i>STDOUT</i> to call <i>WriteCall()</i>, to output
to a terminal via a data structure interface that is associated with the
1st terminal at the interrupt channel <i>TERM0_INTR 35 (I/O base 0x2f8)</i>
or the 2nd terminal at <i>TERM1_INTR 36 (I/O base 0x3e8)</i>. Therefore,
<i>WriteCall()</i> will have new devices to perform the call differently.
<p>
<li>
The <i>WriteCall()</i> is the <i>upper half</i> of the device driver which
issues an I/O service, which will send the user string, one character at
a time to a <i>terminal output queue</i>. This operation is subjected to
an <i>output flow-control mutex</i> in order to synchronize the data transfer.
<p>
<li>
The <i>TermSR</i> is the <i>lower half</i> of the device driver, which in
term, will send what is buffered in the terminal output queue, one character
at a time to the data register of the I/O port, and, issue a mutex unlock
on the terminal output mutex (and thus the upper half can be released).
<p>
<li>
The terminal interface is a data structure that contains:
<ol type=a>
<li>a flag for the readiness of the terminal
<li>the I/O base number of the terminal port
<li>a flow-control mutex ID <i>out_mux</i>
<li>an output queue to buffer the user string
</ol>
<p>
<li>
The given <i>proc.c</i> contains the routine to initialize terminals.
InitProc() will call it twice to initialize two terminals. It also does
as an example a <i>busy-wait</i> method to print newline characters to
clear the terminal display.
<p>
<li>
Caused by the port initialization as well as sending a character to the
terminal port to display, the remote terminal will feedback with a signal
to cause an interrupt TERM0_INTR or TERM1_INTR, and thus triggers (if the
PIC mask and the system interrup table have been programmed correctly)
the corresponding entry point in <i>k-entry.S</i>, and then the Kernel()
where there are two new cases to call:
<ol type=a>
<li>TERM0_INTR: call TermSR(0), 0 is the index to the terminal array for
the 1st terminal; and send back to the PIC the done value.
<li>TERM1_INTR: call TermSR(1), 1 is the index to the terminal array for
the 2nd terminal; and send back to the PIC the done value.
</ol>
<p>
<li>
Finally, the lower half of the device driver <i>TermSR()</i> executes:
<ol type=a>
<li>read the type of event from the <i>IIR</i> register of the terminal port,
<li>if the event is <i>TXRDY</i>, call subroutine <i>TermTxSR()</i>,
<li>if the event is <i>RXRDY</i>, call subroutine <i>TermRxSR()</i> (which
does nothing but just return in this phase),
<li>at the end, check the <i>tx_missed</i> flag in the terminal interface
data structure, and if it is true, call the TermTxSR() again.
</ol>
<p>
<li>
About <i>TermTxSR</i>:
<ol type=A>
<li>if the output queue of the terminal is empty:
<ol type=a>
<li>set the tx_missed flag to TRUE, and
<li>return
</ol>
<li>otherwise:
<ol type=a>
<li>get the 1st character from the output queue,
<li>send it to the <i>DATA</i> register of the terminal,
<li>set the tx_missed to FALSE, and
<li>unlock the output mutex of the terminal.
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
<li>
More details are in </i>CodingHints.txt</i>. Your OS must be able to serve
two terminals. UserProc with odd PID's (1, 3, 5, etc.) use the 1st terminal
(<i>TERM0_INTR</i>), and even ones use the 2nd terminal (<i>TERM1_INTR</i>).
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<blockquote>
<li>
As before, the source code is to be submitted to your designated Voyager dropbox.
Your result must be able to write to two terminals.
<p>
<li>
Usage of code from the past will be deemed as plagiarism. Not meeting requirements
will incur significant point deductions.
</blockquote>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<blockquote>
<li>
How can an <i>busy-wait</i> WriteCall() be made? What are the pros and cons to have
it made with this method? What about <i>busy-poll</i>?
<p>
<li>
Expand from above, the concept of a "cooperative" OS (c.f. "preemptive"):
voluntary sleep/delay calls, requesting to lower own scheduling priority?
What is the "nice" unix command.
<p>
<li>
Can a range check on an input arguments be simply handled by the code in
sys-call.c? What would be the side effects? How does a real OS handle this?

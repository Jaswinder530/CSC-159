<big><b>Goals</big></b>
<p>
<blockquote>
In this OS phase we will extend our OS services to interprocess communication
(IPC). A common IPC method is the <i>mutex</i>. It provides processes a method
to avoid "racing/conflicting" conditions in order to synchronize in a collective
operation.
<p>
This service will be tested by processes gaining usage of the video
display mutual-exclusively, in order not to clobber the display.
Each process will first call a OS service to lock a video mutex before
continuing to write to the video display. If failing to lock it, the
process will be suspended in a suspension queue in the mutex. A process
not suspended would normally issue another OS service to unlock the mutex
so another process can lock the mutex.
<p>
The part of the process code (between the lock and unlock calls) is a
guarded critical code section, and data accessed in the section are
critical data.
<p>
A mutex is first allocated by a process via a OS service. An initial
value for the mutex flag is given. This number sets the maximum allowable
processes that can enter its critical section. Processes complying to the
use of this IPC are designed by programmers. It is not the duty of the OS
to enforce the use of an IPC.

<big><b>Mutex Service Routines</big></b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
There are two service calls: <i>MuxCreateCall</i> and <i>MuxOpCall</i>. The former
requests/initializes for a mutex. The latter either lock or unlock a mutex.
The MuxCreateCall has both input and output elements in its C inline assembly.
This requires combining the asm() syntax from GetPidCall and SleepCall.
<p>
<li>The <tt>int MuxCreateCall(int flag)</tt> leads to <tt>int MuxCreateSR(int)</tt>
which allocates a mutex from the OS mutex queue, empty the mutex and set the flag and
creater, and return the mutex ID via a register of the trapframe (similar to how
GetPidSR() does).
<p>
<li>The call <tt>void MuxOpCall(int mux_id, int opcode)</tt> leads to <tt>void
MuxOpSR(int mux_id, int opcode)</tt>. If the given <i>opcode</i> is <i>LOCK</i>,
the SR:
<ol type=I>
<li>decrement the flag in the mutex by 1 if it is greater than 0, otherwise,
<li>suspend the calling process by:
<ol type=A>
<li>queue the PID of the calling process to a suspension queue in the mutex,
<li>alter the process state to <tt>SUSPEND</tt>, and,
<li>reset the current running PID to NONE.
</ol>
</ol>
The other opcode to the MuxOpCall() is <i>UNLOCK</i>, and the SR:
<ol type=I>
<li>if no suspended process in the suspension queue of the mutex, just increment
the flag of the mutex by 1;
<li>otherwise, release the 1st PID in the suspension queue:
<ol type=A>
<li>move it to the ready-to-run PID queue, and
<li>update its state.
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>

<big><b>New OS Resources</big></b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
An array of mutex <tt>mux_t mux[MUX_SIZE]</tt> (the array indices are also
mutex ID's), to be dispatched for processes.
Each mutex has <i>int flag</i> (aforementioned) and <i>int creater</i>
(the PID of the process that requested to create it), as well as a
<i>q_t suspend_q</i> to queue suspended PID's. 
<p>
<li>
All the available mutex ID's will be initially queued into a <i>q_t mux_q</i>.
<p>
<li>
To guard the video access a <tt>int vid_mux</tt> is needed. It which will be
created as InitProc() issues a MuxCreateCall() at the beginning of its code.
The value 1 will be the initial flag value.
</ol>

<big><b>Deliverables</big></b>
<p>

<ol>
Source code only, dropped to the correct dropbox folder on the host Voyager
as before. Misplaced files will incur penalties.
</ol>
<p>

<big><b>Questions to Review</big></b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
Enter shell command on an ECS Linux host: ipcs -l for the information
about the IPC service parametrics from the OS. Where are the "config"
files the OS administrator can set them? (Answers: /etc/sysctl.conf and
/proc/sys/kernel/sem.)
<p>
<li>
What if a video-using process does not call MuxOpCall() to unlock? What kind
of event will this become? Can/should an OS detect and resolve this condition?
<p>
<li>
What will be valid purposes of setting the inital <i>flag</i> of a mutex to
be different values besides 1? Such as 3, 0, or even -1?
<p>
<li>
What are process <i>starvation</i>, <i>deadlock</i>, and <i>livelock</i>?
Can you give possible coding examples that may cause them?
</ol>

<big><b>Phase 6 &nbsp; Process Life Cycle</big></b>
</center>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<ol>
<li>
To furnish a complete process life cycle with these kernel service calls:
<ol type=i>
<li><i>int ForkCall(void)</i>, which creates a child process resembling its parent;
<li><i>int WaitCall(void)</i>, which suspends the calling parent process until a
child process exits; and
<li><i>void ExitCall(int)</i>, is to exit and return an exit code to the parent process.
</ol>
<p>
<li>
After the creation of a child process via a ForkCall(), the parent process will
issue a WaitCall() which suspends the parent until a child process requests to
exit with an ExitCall(). The child process thus runs in the <i>foreground</i>
like a subroutine for its parent, and the parent resumes after the child exits.
<p>
<li>
The <i>fork</i> service duplicates the calling process (<i>parent</i>)
to an identical copy (<i>child</i>) that continues the execution point
immediately after the <i>int ?</i> instruction, but will be using its
own runtime stack for local varialbes. A child process <i>inherits</i>
all accesses of devices and files from its parent process.
<p>
<li>
"One call, two returns." A successful fork call returns the child PID
to the parent process, and 0 to the new child process. The return value
is often used to separate the subsequent code in the algorithm design.
<p>
<li>
The <i>ForkSR</i> first allocates a new PID which leads to a new PCB and
a runtime stack. The new PCB is first cleared and then initialized:
<ol type=i>
<li> process state, 
<li> parent PID (ppid), and
<li> trapframe location (copy from the parent but subject to an adjustment).
</ol>
<p>
<li>
The runtime stack is a duplicate of the parent's runtime stack but needs a
few location adjustments. The location changes is from the parent's stack
to the new child's stacks. This difference should be applied to the child's
trapframe pointer and involved registers in the trapframe:
<i>ESP</i>, <i>EBP</i>, <i>ESI</i>, and <i>EDI</i>; and other EBP
values (of a caller-callee series) in the new stack (explained below).
<p>
<li>
The EBP of the trapframe is the current one in use (as a callee -- ForkCall),
and where it points to is another EBP (of the caller), and so on.
Program code uses the runtime stack as working memory frames for callers and
callees. Each caller-callee pair operates in its own stack frame and the
<i>base</i> of the stack frame is pointed to by the <b><i>EBP</b></i> register.
All local identifiers and variables are located based on the EBP. Hence, a
chain of <i>EBP</i> values are pushed in the stack if there has been a sequence
of subroutine calls. All EBP values saved are required to apply the location
adjustment. Starting from adjusting the EBP of the trapframe, followed by
what it points, and so on, until it points to a NUL value (delimiter value).
</ol>

<h3>Child Exits First, or Parent Waits First</h3>
<ol>
<li>
If a child process calls ExitCall() before its parent calls WaitCall(),
the <i><b>ExitSR()</b></i> will alter the process to a <b><i>ZOMBIE</b></i>
state (not yet terminated so resources used cannot be returned, even it
is no longer running). As its parent process subsequently issues a WaitCall(),
the <b><i>WaitSR()</b></i> then reclaims the resources, besides the information
<i><b>exit code</i></b> of the 'zombie' child.
<p>
<li>
It may also occur as such that a parent process issues a WaitCall()
before a child exits, the parent will then be blocked in a
<b><i>WAIT</b></i> state, and is no longer running. As a child
process subsequently exits, the parent will then be released, with
the child exit code obtained. Thereafter resources of the child
process are then reclaimed.
</ol>


<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Correct errors in the grading results once they get posted, or you may
get the same error points deducted again.
<p>
<li>
As before, submit only source-code files (*.c *.h events.S) to your
team dropbox on host Voyager, in the designated phase folder.
<p>
<li>
All other rules declared from previous phases regarding not to mess
up submission directories and not to conduct plagiarism also apply.
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
How can a child process <i>inherit</i> the resources that its parent
is currently using? Should the ownerships of resources be kept by the
kernel and the usage and access to them be controlled?
<p>
<li>
What can a child process be aware and cognizant that it is not the parent?
<p>
<li>
How can an <i>execl()</i> service be made? Can we design a similar one?
<p>
<li>
What's a foreground-running process? A background-running process?
Has this to do with any signal services?
</ol>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<blockquote>
The goal of this phase is to learn how an input device driver is constructed
to read from multiple terminals. Input events are asynchronous from terminal
keyboards. The demo runtime with the <i>n</i> key pressed twice on the target
PC window will create two <i>UserProc</i> processes which in term will prompt
to terminals and gather inputs from them, and show them onto the target PC.
To prompt is the output capability achieved from the previous OS phase. The
input, however, is the focus of this phase.

<h3>The Upper Half -- <i>ReadCall</i></h3>
<ol>
<li>
A new <b><i>ReadCall()</b></i> is needed to gather input from a
terminal keyboard. The usage is similar to WriteCall() where the
device and string buffer are given. The return condition in the
call is either a NUL character is read (end of input string),
or the number of input characters is exceeding what STR_SIZE can
accommodate.
<p>
<li>
Similar to the output requirement, the <i>terminal interface</i> data
structure will need an input queue to buffer the input characters, and
a mutex associated with the queue. Plus, an echo-back queue to echo the
input back to the terminal.
<p>
<li>
The usage of the above new components: the upper half of the device
driver first locks the input mutex before dequeues the out queue for
one input character (copy it to the input string of the calling process),
until either a NUL character is read (also copied), or the input is
exceeding the string capacity. (The end-of-string delimiter -- NUL
character, is still to be added as the last character in the string.)
During the ReadCall(), the process is said to be <i>blocked</i>.
</ol>

<h3>The Lower Half -- <i>TermRxSR</i></h3>
<ol>
<li>
Once a key is pressed at a terminal, it will arrive at the terminal port
of the target PC. This will cause an interrupt signal (TERMx_INTR), and
the lower half of the device driver will subsequently get to handle it.
<p>
<li>
The lower half of the device driver is <i>void TermRxSR(int term_no)</i>,
triggered by the event <i>RXRDY</i> read from the <i>IIR</i> of a serial port,
will read in the key-ed character from the port I/O base (+ DATA), and append
it to both of the terminal <i>in_q</i> and <i>echo_q</i> buffers. If the character
read is a <i>Carriage Return (CR)</i> ('\r'), the in_q should get a <i>NUL</i> ('\0')
instead. As to the echo_q, it should still get the CR, but append a <i>New Line
(NL)</i> character ('\n') to the echo_q.

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
<li>
As before, submit only source-code files (*.c, *.h, and k-entry.S) to your team
dropbox on host Voyager, in the designated phase folder.
<p>
<li>
All other rules declared from previous phases regarding not to mess up
submission directories and not to conduct plagiarism also apply.
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The input function described is a <i>full-duplex</i> communication mode. What
is the advantage of this and what about at the time of a password entry?
<p>
<li>
What are ways to design a device driver? Using a wait, poll, or interrupt-driven
approach? Or, a hybrid of modes?
<p>
<li>
What are the pros and cons of the different approaches mentioned above?
<p>
<li>
What are the pros and cons of implementing both halves of a device driver as
SR's? As a process? Or, a mixture of the two?
<p>
<li>
What is a <i>bus</i>? How can a bus device driver be implemented?
</ol>
